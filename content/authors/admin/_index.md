Hi! I am Dr. Anderson Soares, a senior geospatial data scientist with extensive experience in remote sensing with focus in image processing. I hold a Master of Science in Geodetic Sciences and Geoinformatics (UFPE, 2015) and a PhD in Remote Sensing (INPE, 2019).

I have experience in using optical remote sensing data such as LANDSAT, Sentinel, Planet, CBERS, and Ven&mu;s to extract valuable insights for agricultural practices. My expertise encompasses:

<ul>
  <li>Spatiotemporal analysis of remote sensing data for vegetation studies.</li>
  <li>Development of predictive models for mapping and monitoring vegetation health.</li>
  <li>Automation of spatial analysis processes using tools such as Python, geopandas, pandas, gdal, rasterio, and pysal.</li>
</ul>

I am a highly motivated professional with a thirst for knowledge. Currently, I focus on exploring new technologies such as spatiotemporal analysis, Artificial Intelligence (AI), geospatial Big Data, time series analysis, and radiometric and atmospheric corrections.
