abstract: Producing reliable land use and land cover maps to support the deployment and operation of public policies is a necessity, especially when environmental management and economic development are considered. To increase the accuracy of these maps, satellite image time-series have been used, as they allow the understanding of land cover dynamics through the time. This paper presents the stmetrics, a python package that provides the extraction of state-of-the-art time-series features. These features can be used for remote sensing time-series image classification and analysis. stmetrics aims to be an easy-to-use package. The package is available under the GNU GPL software license, and the full source code is available for download at github.com/andersonreisoares/stmetrics.
